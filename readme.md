Need ends for your SBM-20-1? is file contains freecad models, exported 3d models, engineering drawings, and G-code Generated by PrusaSlicer for the Anycubic Kobra 2. I would suggest you re-slice the 3d models, print, and change specs to best suit your individual printer. I used 100% infill

The enginnering drawings may need to be slightly altered to get the tightest fit

A bit of sanding is required to remove the base material that the printer may print with, you may also need to open the brass slightly

For the ends I used H62 1/4"(6.5mm) OD Brass Tube 0.5mm Wall Ã— 300mm Length Brass Tubing Seamless Round Tubing

Fillement is inlnand PLA+ True Red fillement 1.75mm

I'll make a more dedicated tutorial on this soon 


one of these models are for the side with the glass end, one is for the side with the metal end.

UPDATES:

ok, so it was a good first revision, but some changes are in order.

to make assembly better I did a test print with a champfer on the end, this made things
for cleaning up excess go much better. However I may need to widen the base part
that fits in a bit more to account for the easier assembly, not sure

Also, on the metal side I need to make the larger hole a bit taller to account
for overprint.
